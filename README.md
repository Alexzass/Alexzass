# Hi, I'm Alex! 👋

I'm a full stack software engineer, with a deep passion for all things that have an electrical current flowing through them. I chose to specify in software engineering because it's one of the first IT related niches I got my hands on and therefore have the most experience in, but also because it was something I genuinely enjoyed doing, alot due to the fact that pressing keyboard keys in rapid succesion is very pleasing in a sensory regard :). My perfectionist personality doesn't allow me to stop there though - I have to understand exactly why and how my software works, as with everything in life. Because software is a heavy abstraction of its underlying parts, I need to understand the way my software impacts the machine's it's running on hardware and vice versa. Software also lives at the highest layers of the OSI model, therefore it is necessary for me to understand how my software's data uplinks/downlinks from each layer to the next respectively until it reaches it's destination. All of that needs to be clear to me before I can confidently declare that I've completed a piece of software.

## 🛠 IT Skills
My expertise in IT is very broad because of my perfectionist personality, but since software is the niche im most confident in, these are my most notable skills:

Languages - TypeScript, Javascript, Rust, Python, SQL, LogQL, HTML, CSS

Frameworks/Libraries - Nextjs, React, Axum, i18n, Recharts

Tools - PostgreSQL, Docker, Docker-Compose, Prometheus, Grafana, Nginx, Git


## 🧠 Goals for the foreseeable future

🔁 Build an HTTP 1 server from scratch using rust (currently working on)

🔑 Implement TCP from scratch to then upgrade my HTTP 1 server to HTTP 2

📫 Self host an SMTP server on FreeBSD

📁 Self host a file server on FreeBSD utilising ZFS

🚦 Learn about PF firewall's configuration to then reinforce said servers
